  <abstract>
    <para>The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) presents validated and verified checklists (inventories) of introduced (alien) and invasive alien species at the country, territory, and associated island level. 

Phase 1 of the project focused on developing validated and verified checklists of countries that are Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Phase 2 which is on-going, aims to achieve global coverage including non-party countries and all overseas territories of countries e.g. Netherlands, France and United Kingdom. Species belonging to all Kingdoms are covered as well as occurring in all Environment/systems. 

Country/ Territory/ Island checklists are reviewed and verified by networks of country or species experts. Verified checklists/ species records as well as those under review are presented on the online GRIIS website (www.griis.org). Individual species records are flagged with a ‘yes’ for verification.  Only verified checklists/ species records are presented on the GBIF Portal.  

This annotated checklist is of introduced (alien) and invasive alien species known to occur in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.</para>
    <para>The introduced species database for Galapagos has been managed by the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) since it was formed and can be found on the CDF website under ‘dataZone’. This is a centralized database for species found in Galapagos and includes contributions from many researchers as well as staff from the Galapagos National Park Directorate, Galapagos Biosecurity Agency, Ministry of Agriculture and other local institutions. 
CDF is currently working on a new design for dataZone that will include new fields for introduced species to meet the requirements of CBD. 
The last review of invasive species in Galapagos was carried out ten years ago. Because of this, the list of invasive species in the checklist is not current. A review of invasive species will be conducted in 2019 using risk analysis tools.</para>

The International Union for Conservation of Nature, (IUCN) describes an Introduced/ Alien and Invasive alien species as follows:  

An Introduced/ Alien species means a species, subspecies, or lower taxon occurring outside of its natural range (past or present) and dispersal potential (i.e. outside the range it occupies naturally or could not occupy without direct or indirect introduction or care by humans) and includes any part, gametes or propagule of such species that might survive and subsequently reproduce. 

An Invasive alien species means an alien species which becomes established in natural or semi-natural ecosystems or habitat, is an agent of change, and threatens native biological diversity.</para>

        <description>
          <para>The draft checklist (inventory) is compiled by collating data and information through a comprehensive literature overview. Additional steps implemented to control the quality of the data are described below.

Taxonomic harmonization and normalization using the GBIF taxonomic backbone
In order to harmonize all species names across countries, species lists are subjected to a normalization process in which taxon rank and taxonomic status are identified and assigned. Spelling and other errors in assigning species authorship are also corrected.

Data validation
The checklist (inventory) compiler team completes a review and validates all the annotations especially those on provenance and &apos;invasiveness&apos; status of the species based on evidence of impact.

Data verification
The checklist (inventory) is submitted to a network of country editors for a review of both accuracy of records, annotations and identification of any significant gaps in the data. Data verification is an iterative process and the activity is declared completed on agreement of all relevant country editors.</para>

          <descriptorValue>GRIIS has global coverage, including the European Overseas Territories and Regions. Where appropriate, Sub-lists have been created for Oceanic Islands- for e.g. Soqotra of Yemen and the Juan Fernandez Islands of Chile. 

Taxonomic coverage includes all Kingdoms Animalia, Bacteria, Chromista, Fungi, Plantae, Protozoa, Viruses.

The annotations recorded in GRIIS include- Species name and authorship, synonyms if used and authorship, Higher taxonomy (kingdom), Environment/system in which the species occurs, provenance or origin of the species, evidence of impact in that country, on biological diversity or natural areas and finally if the presence and biological status is verified. All information sources used to obtain any of the annotations are documented for every species record. A network of nominated country editors has committed to update and verify species records.</descriptorValue>

      <designDescription>
        <description>
          <para>The Global Register of Invasive Species (GRIS) was developed as a concept and prototype by the IUCN SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) in 2006 as part of a project undertaken for the Defenders of Wildlife on the Regulation of Live Animal Imports into the United States. 

The concept was revisited and expanded by the ISSG to address Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 and support its achievement- with the development of the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS). GRIIS hosted by the ISSG compiles annotated and verified country-wise checklists (inventories) of introduced (alien) and invasive alien species. Development and population of the GRIIS was undertaken by the ISSG within the framework of activities of the Information Synthesis and Assessment Working Group of the Global Invasive Alien Species Information Partnership (GIASIP).

A summary of the process
•	The compiler team will conduct a comprehensive lit review of authoritative and credible source information and develop a draft annotated country checklist (inventory) of introduced (alien) and invasive alien species. 
•	Annotations include species name (accepted name and synonym if used by the source), higher taxonomy, environmental/system in which the species occurs, biological status (provenance and invasiveness-based on evidence of impact), 
•	Country editor/editors are identified and consulted with for advice including knowledge of any key resources 
•	Draft checklists (inventories) are submitted to country editors for a review for both accuracy of information and for any significant gaps. Revisions are implemented based on feedback. 
•	Every species record includes a check (indication) if the status has been verified as feedback is received. In cases where ‘evidence of impact’ information is gathered from peer-reviewed literature or reports; the species status will be considered &apos;verified&apos; 
•	Names of the editors as well as the complete reference list of sources consulted is recorded. 
•	Updates will be implemented six-monthly including change in status of species or any new records 
Notes on the annotations
•	Species names recorded from source information are referred to the GBIF taxonomic editor; if the source species name is a synonym, the accepted name is also recorded. This will help us to apply a consistent taxonomy across all inventories 
•	Higher taxonomy- Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Genus and Species with species authority. 
•	Environment system- terrestrial/ freshwater / brackish / marine/ host and combinations 
•	Provenance- a) as recorded by the source information b) as interpreted by the compiler - three options applied are alien, native/alien (if the species is native in a part of a country and alien in another part), provenance uncertain/cryptogenic 
•	Invasiveness based on evidence of impact</para>
